# vRP Shop
Shop Script for vRP FiveM Framework

**Config**  
To add another shop to the script it is very simple. Add a new line in the **cfg.shops** table in config.lua and put the x,y,z in curly brackets. (If you have cfg.ped enabled then you need to add a new line in the cfg.peds table with the peds x,y,z and heading coordinates)

To change the currency go to config.lua and change **cfg.currency = "Â£"** to whatever currency you use on your server! 

To add more items to the menu go to config.lua and make a new line in the **cfg.items table** and use this preset **{name = "ITEMNAME", price = PRICE, itemid = "ITEMID"},**

If you need any support feel free to DM me on discord jud#0001
